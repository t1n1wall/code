Build t1n1wall on FreeBSD 8.4

Install freebsd 8.4 with developer features and login, su to root then;

At this point, you can either;

a) check out the repository (svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/t1n1wall/code/branches/freebsd8/ ),
   make any desired local changes, then execute go.sh while outside
   the working copy:

	# freebsd8/build/scripts/go.sh

   Note that any new files must be 'svn add'ed in order to appear in
   the exported build directory (but no need to commit yet)

OR the easy way;

b) Run the following commands to automatically get the latest version
   from the repository:

   # fetch https://svn.code.sf.net/p/t1n1wall/code/branches/freebsd8/build/scripts/go.sh
   # chmod +x go.sh
   # ./go.sh

This will give you a bash prompt where you should execute './doall.sh'  or execute each of the 5 shell scripts.

if all goes well, you will have generic iso and generic img in /usr/t1n1wall/build84/images/

To start from scratch again, it should be sufficient to delete /usr/t1n1wall/build84 and repeat the steps above.

For the syslinux image, 1) make a fat32 disk/usb 2) run syslinux to create the MBR 3) place syslinux.sys on the disk, 
4) copy memdisk from the syslinux files onto the root of the disk.  Now extract the t1n1wall tgz syslinux image onto the 
root of the disk and boot, and you should have a working t1n1wall on that disk/usb
